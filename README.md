# Roll dice

Python script to roll dice for the purposes of playing tabletop games. Specifically with DnD in mind.

## Features

- [x] Roll any number of dice with any number of sides.
- [x] Add or subtract modifiers.
- [x] Roll with advantage or disadvantage.
- [ ] Evaluate complex expressions, e.g. `2d10+3d8+6+2`.

## Extras

Stupid and overly complicated module for generating ASCII underlines for headers.
In theory, it'd be a  useful tool, but it also feels extremely unnecessary. At some point it'd be cool to make it good.

Features as I remember them:

- Custom mid and end sections.
- Insert text in the middle.
- If text would make the mid section very small, it will use a shorter variant of the text if provided or omit it.
